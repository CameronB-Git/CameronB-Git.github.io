                    school days, exploring its practical applications to simplify daily life.
                    Whether it's by making a small <b>Python</b> script to search the web for
                    information, or creating something new and innovative with <b>C#</b> or some 
                    other programming language.

                <!-- When I REALLY started liking Programming -->
                <p class="pb-2">
                    I started to really enjoy programming when I was 14, when I started to learn
                    <b>Python</b> in my own time, as well as in education. I was able to create small programs
                    to solve problems, which gave me a sense of accomplishment, and I wanted to learn more.
                    I then started to learn <b>C#</b>, allowing me to create more complex and useful programs.
                    There was this feeling I got from programming that I couldn't get from anything else, and 
                    I wanted to keep learning more.
